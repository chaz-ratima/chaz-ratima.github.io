        <h1 class="center-text">EQ vs IQ</h1>  
        <h2>EQ = Emotional Quotient (aka Emotional Intelligence)
            </br>IQ = Intelligence Quotient
        </h2>
        </br>
        <h2>What is Emotional Intelligence?</h2>
        <p>EQ is the perception of emotions and how we deal with them whether its oneselfs emotions or others.
            </br>Based on reasearch by Daniel Goleman EQ can be split into five catergories:
            </br>Self-awareness - Knowing your strengths and weaknesses, and the ability to understand your effect on others.
            </br>Self-management: Being able to control your impulses and avoid acting rashly.
            </br>Motivation: Havng passion to challenge yourself and remain positive when things don't go your way.
            </br>Empathy: Being understanding to what they say and how they feel, not just listening to the words they speak.
            </br>Social Communication: The ability to manage relationships and productively express your emotions.
        </p>
        </br>
        <h2>How is it different to IQ?</h2>
        <p>IQ is the intelligence side of things where it helps us to understand, learn and apply information.
            </br>An example I heard is that: Within the work place, You may have the skills to climb, but its your EQ (Compassion, Confidence, and Control) that shines throughout.
        </p>
        </br>
        <h2>Why is it important?</h2>
        <p>It is important because It determines how good we are when dealing with negative emotions. It reinforces ourselves with positivity so we don't push ourselves to the brink of hopelessness, and it also enables us to be more positive with relationships or just one another. Also, if our EQ is lower, it can hurt our IQ: Meaning that even though we have a higher reasoning ability with higher IQ; If our EQ is low, our rationality to think is clouded by negative emotions.</p>
