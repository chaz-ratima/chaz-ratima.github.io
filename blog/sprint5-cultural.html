            Reflection On Foundation Core Skills:
        </h1>
        <h2>What are three new things you have learned about yourself and your ego as a result of the core learning?</h2>
        <p>
          That I have a big ego, or image I would like to portray myself as. But that image is definitely changing each day because sometimes I don't know what I want to portray myself as. All I need to remember is that I'm here to learn :)
          </br> Because of this I don't ask for help as much as I should and It means I take less breaks than I should and also that I tend to forget everything in the moment and only focus on the task at hand, which is just a habit that I need to break.
          </br> I feel like one of the biggest things for me and my learning, is that half the stuff i'm trying to take in, I just don't understand. For example, like the Kata's, If i'm alone for an hour I will get stuck. And the problem is that I don't know what i'm searching for at times on google and anything I find, I just feel like it's cheating. I know that's because of school and it's more-or-less allowed here, but still :/ Another habit.
        </p>
        <h2>What are the roles of values, empathy and self awareness in learning and programming?</h2>
        <p>
          Values are the things we believe to be important. Empathy is the ability to understand and share feelings with someone else. self-awareness is being able to indentify those emotions within yourself.
        </p>
        <h2>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h2>
        <p>
          The Growth Mindset. I've always known that people can grow. Just like games, you get XP everytime you do/learn something, but it really didn't stick In and I know i'm still one that has this ego where I want people to look at me like I'm not stupid but I am here to learn so I should be putting that behind me.
        </p>
        <h2>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h2>
        <p>
          Confidence. Being willing enough to put yourself, or myself in this case forward and being able to be confident in myself and just being able to communicate (in the moment, without distractions)
        </p>
        <h2>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development bootcamp course?</h2>
        <p>
          As they say, You can teach someone to code but you can't teach someone to Human. Or something like that...
        </p>
        <h2>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practicing programming instead? Justify your answer.</h2>
        <p>
          No. The core part is just as essential as the code. I know for one that a big part of why I choose to do stuff is because I want to grown, not just with technical stuff but because I want to grow "humanly?" lol. Gain confidence and to be able to interact with people without some feeling of anxiety. Also It was interesting to learn about a lot of the stuff, most notably the Growth Mindset.

        <h1>Preparing for bootcamp:</h1>
        <p>
          Long term goal is to make my family proud and make sure they are safe/secure and happy in the future :) For career paths, I've thought it about it a lot but I still haven't come to a final decision, although for now my goal is to finish this course. I would like a career in I.T. whether it be programming, techical hardward side or something to do with games.
          </br> If family is a strength then, that :p They motivate me and make me who I am, and they're one of the reasons why i'm trying to push myself :)
          </br> My biggest non-techincal challange is confidence. I would like to get more confident and be someone that can converse freely to a group/in a group, and input more instead of thinking I lack places or think my ideas aren't good enough. Also, I want to be able to communicate more effective without that feeling of anxiety :)
          </br> MY expectations of myself is that I make sure to attend everything I need to and make sure to get everything done in the set timeframe. With others, I expect to communicate with whoever I need to respectively and ask for help when I need to, not after many moments of struggling. :)
