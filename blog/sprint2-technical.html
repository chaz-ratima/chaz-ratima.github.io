          <h1>What are the best practices associated with using <span class="uppercase"><em>classes</em></span> vs. <span class="uppercase"><em>ids</em></span>?</h1>
          <p>
            I chose to focus on this topic because I used classes and Ids more than I used the elements from the other topics. Although I wouldn't say I'm a master, especially when it comes to giving them names but all we can do is try, right?
          </p>
          <p><em>"Only use IDâ€™s once, but you can use classes over and over."</em></p>
          <p>This is a fundamental that slips through people's minds and they often ask "why not just use Ids?" or "why not just use Classes?" And honestly, even though you <em>could</em> just use classes, it's not how we are supposed to (for reasons such as conflicts, validation, and javascript, etc.) There are uses for both Ids and classes which I will get to down below. Also this fundamental helps when understanding the differences between the two.</p>

          <h3 class="uppercase">Class Selector:</h3>
          <p>
              Classes are used to style more than one element, or to apply many styles to one element.
          </p>

          </br>
          <h3 class="uppercase">Id selector:</h3>
          <p>
              Ids are unique, where you don't want to change a group of elements but only a specific one.

          <h3 class="uppercase">Practical uses:</h3>
          <p>
            To use them practically, we should avoid using classes and Ids when there is no need to. As always make sure to take a look at your code and think "Do I need this?" because if the answer is no, well, then you might want to get rid of it.
          </br>Next, If We choose to use a class, we need to make sure this class will be used consistently throughout the HTML or if there is a group of elements that we want to style. Classes are mainly used for that reason.
          </br>If we choose to use an Id, we need to make sure that this Id will be used once on this page, otherwise, you'll have to use a class. Elements can only have one Id and since they're specific, it would be hard to overlap two Ids. Whereas, Classes may overlap all the time. That is a problem, but If an Id and a class overlap, the Id will have priority.
          </br>There are more uses for the Ids and classes when it comes to javascript but we leave that for the next sprint and we move.
