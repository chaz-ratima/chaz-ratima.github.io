            Problem Solving:
        </h1>
        <h2>Explain a time you got blocked on a simple problem:</h2>
        <p>
          I've got blocked on many problems, but the most recent had to have been with the Kata's. When I was doing them, I felt like "How'd they come up with the function or solution" and It was pretty negative when I felt so under-devolped for the Kata's but I am here to learn so I'm doing my best.
        </p>
        <h2>Explain a time you solved a problem in an elegant way:</h2>
        <p>
          I can't think of the exact problem but I was practising some Kata's on different websites and there were many times where I was stumped but there were some where It felt like I could actually do this. When I did actually solve some of them without needing to search something up, I felt more accomplished than If i had to use something to help me, but I know help isn't a bad thing. But when I can do it myself, It makes me feel like i'm actually learning or something, feels good haha.
        </p>
        <h2>What problem solving techniques did you use?:</h2>
        <p>
          A lot of the time I googled or had to ask. I tried to talk it out in steps or try something, but problems always seem simple when you can break it down, it's just the knowledge I had didn't really make me feel confident and everything I was trying didn't work half the time because I feel like I was writing english more so than actual code.
        </p>
        <h2>How did you feel throughout the process?:</h2>
        <p>
          I know I prefer to do things myself, because to me, it feels more rewarding that I can do it myself. But that is also because i'm stubborn and I never think it's bad to help, especially when you're (I'm) in the learning phase, but I didn't feel very confident in my own abilities.
        </p>
        <h2>What did you learn?:</h2>
        <p>
          I learned more about Objects and Arrays than anything. The slight differences that someone could miss and how to use objects, not just to define something with properties, but the uses you can do with them, which also apply to arrays. The arguements that you put in a function aswell, because I look at what some people put and say "huh? but item was never defined", where in actuality  it's just a placeholder for whatever you're going to input.
        </p>
        <h2>Reflect on how confident you feel using the problem solving techniques and process:</h2>
        <p>
          I feel confident In being able to do all of the problem solving techniques and processes, but if they actually help me is a different case. I feel like I learn better when someone teaches me through it because they can put it in terms (simple terms?) that someone like me will understand. When searching for something, I know for me, when it comes to learning, it's much more difficult when it comes to reading, nothing on the page sticks in my mind, but auditory/visual (mostly visual) help with examples and then I'm like "oh, that's what they does, or how it is used".
