            Nueroplasticity and Growth Mindset:
        </h1>
        </br>
        <h2>Discuss how understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits people:</h2>
        <p>
            If we can all understand that our minds can be broadened by just picking at it through repetition or such, then we can learn to grow more than what we originally perceived.
        </p>
        <h2>Discuss how you might engage with the principals of neuroplasticity for your own benefit:</h2>
        <p>
            By understanding that intelligence is malleable, I can knock those barriers I placed around my brain down, and try to actively seek out change, or like when I feel inferior to something, I know that for now, I might not be able to beat you, but I will practice and learn and become strong enough to destroy you >:D
        </p>
        <h2>What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity:</h2>
        <p>
            repetition (Practice makes perfect). Memory techniques (analogy, linking to life, etc). By understanding Neuroplasticity, we can understand that your actions define you and not how you're born is how you are for the rest of your life.

        <h2>Discuss what it is and why it is relevant:</h2>
        <p>
            A growth mindset is to transform effort and difficulty from a fixed definition to a "yet" definition. Because this will allow people to develop their brains or talents through hard work, etc, while the fixed mindset thinks that your abilities/attributes are defined at birth. 
        </p>
        <h2>In this exploration, did anything surprise you? Change for you?:</h2>
        <p>
            I know that I'm all for change/improvement, but when there is research to back up the results, it's almost jubilating that I If I work hard enough, I can change myself for the better, and reach the person that I want to be, because I know sometimes that I use the excuse that others are smarter or I'm not like that because they were born like that. (Even though I acknowledge how much effort people have/do put into their lives). Sometimes it's out of the negativity that I belittle myself and make everyone seem much better, but I just need to know that I'm not where I want to be exactly because I didn't put the effort I should of, but If I put in more effort now, I could be where I want to soon enough.
        </p>
        <h2>How will you integrate growth mindset into your learning journey?:</h2>
        <p>
            To just make sure that any challenge I find myself in, I approach it and try to learn from it/figure it out. I want to have a growth mindset and not just think everything will bend my way :)
