        My parents split up so I've lived with my dad and his side of the family for the most part. They are Moari and they're how i shaped my self and my values. Within the Maori culture we put a big emphasis on Family/Whanau. When i was younger, although it still happens from time to time, All the cousins/uncles/aunties would come around to my nans house, Whether is was for christmas or just to all meet up, we'd all see eachother and everyone would catch up (most notibly the uncles and aunties all drank together lol). Ever since we younger ones have grown up though, and everyone has moved away, we don't do it very often, but since there is the internet, It's easier to just have a group chat.
        </br>
        </br>With that being said, a pretty recent decision was made where I chose to fly to Dunedin before we had to quarintine. The reason why I flew was to be with my partner who was stuck down there since there was no flights that were available back up to Wellington before level 4 was commenced. It was the first time I would've flown on a plane, Would i be ok down there?. I took everything into consideration and my dad tried to explain that it was safe here, had food, shelter etc. But, I chose to go down and be with her. Felt like someone shouldn't have to be lonely, but more importantly, I just wanted to make sure she was safe. Consequences were that I had to walk and get all the shopping and i'm pretty sure I got bigger in the belly region and face, but my arms bulked up probably so hey!
        </br></br>I'd say Family is the core of my values, and from there more values branched out, like just to respect everyone, whether it was from elders to nature itself. I feel like thats why picking up rubbish when you see any is important :) Although, don't let anyone walk all over you and your mana as they say.
        </br></br>
        I would say motivation is a big reason why i'm even here. If it wasn't for my family or partner, I actually don't know if i would be here or if i would have left my room at all. As they are a big part of my life, they are my reason to why I try to push my self everyday. I want to see myself as a better version of me, but I also just want to give peace at mind to those who worry for me, and I want to be able to take care of those around me. This also gives me determination.
        /br></br>I value honesty a lot. I don't lie and I normally expect everyone else to be honest with me too, but I am not entirely honest with myself sometimes and I think while it's not the most optimal, It really helps me understand my flaws and my mindset.
        </br></br></br>
        I didn't write this with the best english but I normally jump from point-1 to point-2 when I try explain things and then I have a thousand Ideas in my head but I only can write one. I will update it as I go :)
