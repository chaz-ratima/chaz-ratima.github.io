        <h2>What is your long term goal and or career pathway?:</h2>
        <p>
            My real long term goal is just to get a job, become more confident, and make those around me happy/feel safe and supported. Probably a big goal and a many for lots of others but these are the most important to me. Well the job isn't too much of a goal and I feel like money is also becoming a necessity, but I ignore that. I just want to provide to my current family and my future family.
When it comes to career paths, I would love to do something in I.T. It's a passion of mine, and my family is a big push when it comes to doing what I want to do.
        </p>
        <h2>What skills (non-technical - human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at EDA?:</h2>
        <p>
            I would like to improve all of my human skills. To be able to communicate comfortably whether it be solo or in a group without feeling any form of anxiety is one of my long-term goals. Charisma is an attribute I would love to have. I can talk to people and be a good listener, but I'm just the type of person people vent to when they're really low. It's good that I can be that person, but I want to be someone that people can talk to regardless of any topic.
        </p>
        <h2>A description of your own strengths and limitations:</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>Kindness/Love:</strong> Two different things but I think that when you can be kind, the love will spread itself. Also, I might be a bit negative towards myself at times, which I would say happens to a lot of people these days, but I would never be negative towards other people.
            </br></br><strong>Humor:</strong> Love to laugh and make people laugh. Might not be the funniest guy but can always appreciate humor.
        </p>
        <h2>Based on the above description, a commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include - an explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, facilitators and industry/community representatives:</h2>
        <p>
            As long as I can stay within the timeboxes and can hand in work before future due dates, there should be no obstacles. The best way to do that is to set those goals and prioritize them. I'm always going to be respectful and reply to everyone, so don't worry about getting ignored lol. To everyone that I will work with, I hope we can be friends, and I might not be the smartest in the room, but I hope my determination will overcome any challenge we face.
        </p>
        <h2>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way:</h2>
        <p>
            There is the facilitators, the people also doing the course, google, etc. All I need to do is ask when I need to. (Remembering to stick to the framework)
        </p>
        <h2>A description of what you expect from the facilitation team:</h2>
        <p>
            I just expect friendliness. I know its a flipped classroom and there won't be any 'teachers' but I hope to learn from them through experience or them saying things.
        </p>
        <h2>Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whanau commitments such as school drop-offs. Itâ€™s important to plan these in:</h2>
        <p>
            I'm fully committed to this course!
        </p>
