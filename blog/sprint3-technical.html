        <h2>An analogy to describe the differences between HTML and CSS:
        </h2>
        <p>Wrote this before, but a barber and a customer represent HMTL and CSS well. That being the customer is the HTML, providing the content with the hair they walked in with, and the barber being the CSS which provides the style for that hair.

        <h2>Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday life, for example 'waking up' or 'brushing your teeth'. (But not those ones):
        </h2>
        <p>Control Flow is the order in which the computer executes the code.
          </br>Loops are code that just loop until the desired outcome executes, where the loop stops.
          </br>An example for control flow is just plain instructions. We may be given a set of instructions that we must complete in order from what we were first told to the last thing that was said, and we just go about it.
          </br>For loops, an example that I can think of is how we try to work on a task. Some people like to try to solve it, take a break, re-evaluate, then repeat, and end up getting no where, sometimes. But, when it works out, we get our desired result, which ends the loop until we get stuck again and then the cycle continues.

        <h2>Describe what the DOM is and an example of how you might interact with it:
        </h2>
        <p>Dom = Document objecy model.
            The DOM is a browsers internal projection of a webpage. It can be munipulated using such tools as the in-built dev tools on chrome for example but also by languages such as javascript. The DOM is often seen as a "hierarchical structure" made up of different Nodes in a format being easy to understand for the browser.
            </br>Nodes are everything that make up a website from elements to text conent to everything else; They are the objects. Above is an example of how the DOM is viewed and represents that each branch is leading to a child Node from a parent Node = "hierarchy structure" "Family-tree structure" etc.
        </p>
        <h2>Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects:
        </h2>
        <p>
          Arrays hold information or values which are the same type, where as objects contain information on objects with different properties.
          </br>Both can be accessed similarly with [] bracket notations for example, except Arrays use Index numbers because of where/what number the information is stored in that array. While objects use the property that we have used.
        </p>
        <h2>Explain what functions are and why they are useful:
        </h2>
        <p>
            Functions are a block of statements that perform a task. This is useful because if/when we want to execute a bunch of statements many times, we can just call the function which will runs those same set of statements till you get your desired result.
